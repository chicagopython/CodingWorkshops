## Python Project Night - Learn something new every month

Welcome to the Python Projects Night organized by Chicago Python User Group or ChiPy. 
Here you will find python challenges that we solve together as a groups every third 
Thursday of the month at 6:30 pm at Braintree's Chicago Office. This repository has the
collection of the Challenge problems that we solve at Project Nights.

## Code of Conduct
[Here](http://www.chipy.org/pages/conduct/) is our code of conduct.


## Contributors
Thanks to those who come down Python Project Night every month. Here is the list of folks who have
spent their time in bringing this repository to you.
* [Nik](https://github.com/sharma7n)
* [Hector Rios](https://github.com/hectron)


## Challenge Problems
Challenge problems are fun, hands-on coding exercises covering a variety of topics -- such as pure problem solving, web development, and data science. The participants of Project Night are assigned to teams of four, and then solve the problem together in an hour. Teams are designed to have diverse experience levels, giving team members equal opportunity to learn and share ideas.


### What you need
* Wi-fi powered laptop, power chord
* Python: 3.5 (We can not guarantee help if you are using Python 2.7)
* Text editor: Atom, Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code
* OS: GNU/Linux. OS X, Windows


## Previous Projects
Here is a list of projects we have solved previosuly. These are great exercises
if you are planning to get level up your skills. Try them out and if you need any
help [ask us on slack](https://chipy.slack.com/messages/C4SRS5G3B/details/) 

### Python101
#### Python Koans
For this exercise we will learn the Zen of Python using Test Driven Development.
Python Koans is a suite of broken tests, which are written against Python code that 
demonstrate how to write idiomatic python.
Your job is to fix the broken tests by filling in the missing parts of the code.

#### Python Team Projects
The organizers of Project Nights need your help! Grouping attendees for Project Night team project is a manual task. Why do it manually, when we can automate it? We open up the problem to you.

[Solve it!](problems/py101/python_team_project)


#### Pytest Team Projects
This is an introduction to testing using pytest that uses the same problem as above of grouping project night attendees into teams of 4.

### WebDev
#### Flask Team Projects
Build a web app for to group the Python project night  attendees.

#### Flask Collage
Build a small web app using Flask which accepts the meetup.com event id for tonight
as a parameter and would fetch the profile pictures of all the attendees to create a
collage.

### Data Science

#### Data Analysis With Pandas
Pandas is the defacto package for data analysis in Python. In this project, we are going to use the basics of pandas to analyze the interests of project Night's attendees. What can we learn about the Python Project Night's attendees by mining their meetup.com
profile data?

#### Diversif.ai
Diversity in tech communities has been a widely addressed topic. As one of the most active tech community in the world, in this exercise we would try to measure some aspects of diversity in tech community. We will use image recognition on the meetup.com profile pictures of the members of ChiPy user group and determine determine how diverse our attendees are. Then we will compare the same with other tech groups in the city and around the world.

#### Introduction to Text Analysis with sklearn
This is a gentle introduction to text analysis with sklearn. We build a recommnedation system that predicts
Pycon conference talks based on previous history of Pycon talks.
