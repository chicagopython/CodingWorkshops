    "Welcome to our team project for Data Science. In this exercise we will build up on the foundations created in our last two team projects where we devised an algorithm to group attendees of Python Project Night and built a web based roster app that can be use the algorithm for grouping.\n",

    "This will give you a gentle introduction to handling data with pandas, using a third party machine learning SaaS api to do image recognition.\n",

    "## Problem Definition\n",
    "\"Diversity is the engine of invention.\" Justin Trudeau, 2016\n",
    "\n",
    "Diversity in tech communities has been a widely addressed topic. As one of the most active tech community in the world, in this exercise we would try to measure some aspects of diversity in tech community. We will use image recognition on the meetup.com profile pictures of the members of ChiPy user group and determine determine how diverse our attendees are. Then we will compare the same with other tech groups in the city and around the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Before we go further\n",
    "The first proof of concept implementation did not take long, and it concerned me. If it is so easy build tools that can be potentially abused or misinterpreted, we need to think through the implications of the tools we build. So if you are concerned, we are on the same page. There is a question at around the middle of the project to address this.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Just the beginning\n",
    "Note the approach used in this is a crude first step and is not without flaws. Like all software, what you will build is incomplete and needs a lot of refinement (that's why this is open source!) before we can get comprehensive results. *So take the initial results of your analysis with copious amount of salt.*\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we are going to look at just one facet of diversity - gender diversity of the members.\n",
