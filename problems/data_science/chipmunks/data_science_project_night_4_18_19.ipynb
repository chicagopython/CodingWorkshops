    "As ChiPy leadership was preparing for [PyCon](https://us.pycon.org/2019/) at the end of this month, they found that the dataset on our infamous *ChiPy chipmunks* has disapeared. While they transition from Oracle to Postgres, the leadership team has enlisted your help as data scientists to analyze some salvaged chipmunk data. The PyCon organizers had a few questions about coding in Chicago, ChiPy, and chipmunks that need answers. We will get to those questions shortly, but first let's get to the data. If you haven't set up your environment, make sure to checkout the project night page on the [website](http://chicagopython.github.io/chipy-chipmunks).\n",
