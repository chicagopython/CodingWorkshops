    "### Recommendation System\n",
    "We live in a world surrounded by recommendation systems - our shopping habbits, our reading habits, political opinions are heavily influenced by recommendation algorithms. So lets take a closer look at how to build a basic recommendation system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply put a recommendation system learns from your previous behavior and tries to recommend items that are similar to your previous choices. While there are a multitude of approaches for building recommendation systems, we will take a simple approach that is easy to understand and has a reasonable performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise we will build a recommendation system that predicts which talks you'll enjoy at a conference.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recommendation for Pycon talks\n",
    "With 32 tuotorials, 12 sponsor workshops, 16 talks at the education summit, and 95 talks at the main conference - Pycon has a lot to offer. Reading through all the talk descriptions and filtering out the ones that you should go to is a tedious process. \n",
    "Lets build a recommendation system that recommends talks from this year's Pycon based on the ones that you went to last year. This way you don't waste any time deciding which talk to go to and spend more time making friends on the hallway track! \n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [`scikit-learn`](http://scikit-learn.org/) to build the recommnedation system using the text description of talks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definitions\n",
    "#### Documents\n",
    "In our example the talk descriptions make up the documents\n",
    "#### Class\n",
    "We have two classes to classify our documents\n",
    "- The talks that the user would like to see \"in person\". Denoted by 1\n",
    "- The talks that the user would watch \"later online\". Denoted by 0\n",
    "\n",
    "A talk description is labeled 0 would mean the user has chosen to watch it later and a label 1 would mean the user has chose to watch it in person.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supervised Learning\n",
    "In Supervised learning we inspect each observation in a given dataset and manually label them. These manually labeled data is used to construct a model that can predict the labels on new data. We will use a Supervised Learning technique called Support Vector Machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "In unsupervised learning we do not need any manual labeling. The recommendation system finds the pattern in the data to build a model that can be used for recommendation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "The dataset contains the talk description and speaker details from Pycon 2017 and 2018. All the 2017 talk data has been labeled by a user who has been to Pycon 2017."
